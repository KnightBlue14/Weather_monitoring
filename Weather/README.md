Some files to provide examples of how the data gathered using the scripts in the main branch can be used for analysis.

Leeds.csv is a file created with the Weather_pull.py script from the main branch, and was used to create the other files in this filder.

The PNG files were created in Tableau Public, a data visualisation tool that allows you to create detailed graphs, and present them as part of a series. In this case, they have been used to track temperatures across multiple cities, as well as compare it to the level of pollutsnts.

The py-notebook is for a pyspark instance, using the Leeds.csv dataset. It includes a number of numerical operations, as well as filtering methods for navigating the dataframe.
